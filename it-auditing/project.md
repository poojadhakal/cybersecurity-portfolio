# IT Security Auditing

## Project Description

In today's digital age, information is a significant business tool. Making sure that
sensitive data is protected from fraud, misuse, and other cyber dangers is essential.

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company data requires
information security audits. The issue is that many firms do not completely comprehend
the significance of information security audits or fail to adopt appropriate auditing
methods. This might result in several problems, Such as

• Firms without adequate audits are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches, as
their security infrastructure may be vulnerable to hackers.
• Organizations without appropriate security measures may fail to operate in several
sectors or face legal and financial consequences.
• Organizations may not have complete visibility into their security position without
effective audits, making it difficult to identify and reduce security concerns.
• A data breach or cyber-attack may damage a company's reputation, leading to lost
clients and commercial opportunities (eBiz Group, 2018).

In this project, I focus on the two major case studies covering data breach and supply chain attack. The report focuses on security threats, security policies, practices, and control to find
weaknesses and potential security concerns. It entails conducting systematic assessments of
security controls, policies, and processes to discover vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and
compliance gaps. Security auditing's key goals are to proactively minimize risks, satisfy
regulatory obligations, and improve an organization's overall security posture. Security
auditing is critical in the ever-changing field of cybersecurity, assisting firms in staying ahead
of emerging threats, protecting sensitive information, and maintaining a resilient and secure IT
infrastructure.

### Case I: Equifax data breach in the US

Equifax Inc., a worldwide data, analytics, and technology firm, reported on September 7,
2017, that it had been the target of a huge cyber breach impacting 143 million individuals or
nearly 56% of American adults (The New York Times, 2017). This cyber catastrophe surpassed
the 2015 Yahoo assault as the greatest data leak in US history. Hackers were able to get the
names, addresses, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and credit card information
of hundreds of millions of people as a result of this data breach. Equifax stated that the attack
was made possible via a weakness in Apache structs2. Companies utilize Struts2 to construct
Java web applications. Equifax's failure to address a software vulnerability in its system
allowed for the hack to take place. This flaw enabled attackers to attackers to send an HTTP
request with malicious code tucked in the content type header (Thomas, 2019).

#### Issue Identification

The Equifax data breach in 2017 was a significant occurrence that exposed the personal and
financial information of millions of people. Several critical concerns contributed to the breach:

• Inadequate security measures: The Equifax data breach in 2017 was one of the greatest
in history owing to several security failings, including poor server segmentation and
plain text password storage. As a result, attackers might exploit weaknesses in one
server and move laterally over the network, obtaining access to other computers. Proper
segmentation would have reduced their ability to traverse the network, limiting the
scope of the attack.

• Vulnerability: In Equifax’s web application software, which used an unpatched version
of Apache Struts, the attackers were able to take advantage of a vulnerability. The
vulnerability was well publicized, and a fix had been available for several months
before the intrusion. Equifax’s systems were exposed to the assault because they did
not implement the fix as soon as they should have.

• Delayed response: Equifax was criticized for its slow response to a data breach, which
led to charges of insider trading. This Incident highlighted the importance of prompt
and open communication and the need for appropriate procedures and controls to
prevent unethical activity.

• Failed to renew an encryption certificate: Equifax’s inability to renew an encryption
certificate on one of their internal security products was exploited by attackers, allowing
them to access sensitive data and exfiltrate it without being caught. This incident
highlights the importance of cybersecurity procedures such as system upgrades and
patching to guard against vulnerabilities (Fruhlinger, 2020).

#### Mitigation
Security audits are essential for data protection and breach prevention, as they assess an
organization’s security controls and identify any openings or gaps that an attacker may take
advantage of. These audits could have mitigated the impact of the Equifax data breach.

• Incident response plan: Equifax responded quickly to a data breach by informing
consumers and employing a cybersecurity firm to analyze the issue. Companies should
have a robust incident response strategy in place.

• Proposed reforms: There were demands for changes and improvements in the aftermath
of the Equifax incident to offer customers more control over their credit reports and
personal data. This entails giving users unlimited access, giving them control over how
their data is shared, and putting in place more robust security measures to safeguard
sensitive data.

• Improving security measures: Equifax has worked to strengthen its security practices,
such as using encryption, multi-factor authentication, vulnerability assessments, and
penetration testing. These efforts are meant to strengthen their systems and protect them
against future data breaches.

• Offering Free credit monitoring: In reaction to the data breach, Equifax is providing
free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to the impacted clients, which can
assist users in spotting and dealing with fraudulent behavior. Unfortunately, credit
monitoring is not a failsafe approach for avoiding identity theft and may not detect all
forms of fraud.

#### Summary
According to the case study, the Equifax data breach exposed the vulnerabilities among
companies that manage and preserve private consumer data. It recognized the need for
organizations to be more proactive in cybersecurity, such as implementing robust security
measures, testing their systems for weaknesses, doing security audits, and disclosing any data
breaches. It also emphasized the necessity of transparency and direct communication with those
affected.

### Case II: EquSolar wind supply chain attack

SolarWinds, a network management solution used by over 300,000 clients globally, was
compromised by Russian hackers in 2020. The hackers were part of the Russian SVR (Foreign
Intelligence Service) and were successful in compromising an Orion software update, allowing
them access to their networks and data. Homeland Security, the Justice Department, and the
Treasury Department were all compromised. Security firm FireEye identified the intrusion and
notified the US authorities. The SolarWinds example highlights the global implications of a
single corporation being attacked because it has access to the internet. other companies’ data,
leading to substantial amounts of data being compromised (Williams, 2023).

#### Issues Identification

The SolarWinds supply chain assault, also known as the Sunburst attack, was a sophisticated
cyberattack that happened in 2020. It involves undermining SolarWinds' software supply chain,
a well-known vendor of IT management software. The attack vector involves compromising
the software development process and introducing harmful malware into legal software
upgrades. The exact vulnerability exploited in the assault was tied to the SolarWinds Orion
Platform, a widely used IT infrastructure monitoring and management system. The attackers
were able to implant a backdoor into the program, which stayed unnoticed for a prolonged
period.
Once customers installed the compromised SolarWinds updates, the malicious code allowed
the attackers to gain unauthorized access to the affected organizations' networks. The attack
was highly sophisticated and stealthy, aimed at avoiding detection by security measures and
blending in with legitimate network traffic (Jeferson Martínez, 2021).


#### Mitigation

After the SolarWinds incident, attempts to improve supply chain risk management and tighten
cybersecurity measures have been made. The United States government has issued many
executive orders aimed at enhancing cybersecurity, including one requiring federal entities to
use multi-factor authentication and encryption measures. Several businesses have also added
extra security measures, such as more vendor network monitoring, better encryption, and
enhanced incident response procedures. Several businesses have begun to diversify their
vendor portfolios to lessen their reliance on a single provider.

#### Summary
From the case study, the SolarWinds supply chain assault was a highly skilled and well-
thought-out cyberattack that had several targets in mind. The virus, known as Sunburst or
Solorigate, was designed to lay dormant for up to two weeks before activating and connecting
with an attacker-controlled command-and-control server. The assault had a broad and
considerable impact, impacting a wide range of businesses, including US government agencies,
technology corporations, and financial institutions. Organizations implemented several
strategies to lessen the attack's effects (Sam Shead, 2021).


## Conclusion

Identification, and overall security posture improvement. Organizations may detect possible
security risks and vulnerabilities, adhere to rules, and enhance their overall security posture by
regularly performing audits. The relevance of IT security audits will rise as an organization's
security program must include IT security audits since they may aid with regulatory
compliance, risk, and vulnerability technology improvements, and firms must prioritize them
to safeguard sensitive information and assets from cyber-attacks. Auditing helps to identify
security problems and gaps, as well as system weakness, and establish a security baseline that
future audits can compare with identifying unnecessary resources so that fewer chances of loss
of data (Luke Irwin, 2022).
Finally, security auditing is a critical component of IT security that assists firms in proactively
identifying and mitigating possible security issues. Organizations may examine the efficiency
of their security controls, uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and take the necessary steps
to enhance their security posture by performing frequent security audits. In today's digital
world, where cyber threats are continually developing and getting more complex, security
auditing is especially vital. It allows firms to meet legal obligations, create confidence with
stakeholders, and detect and respond to security events rapidly. Finally, security auditing assists
firms in protecting their critical assets, systems, and data against illegal access, data breaches,
and other security events.
